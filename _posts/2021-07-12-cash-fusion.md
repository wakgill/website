>CashFusion is a fully decentralized privacy protocol that allows anyone to create multi-party transactions with other network participants. This process obscures your real spending and makes it difficult for chain-analysis companies to track your coins. - [CashFusion FAQ](https://cashfusion.org/faqs/)

Don't use [CashFusion,](https://cashfusion.org/) or [mixing tools,](https://coinjoin.io/) to "un-KYC" your Bitcoin.

Whatever forward-facing privacy CashFusion gives you, it
does nothing for your financial privacy up to the point you fused or mixed your coin, nor
does it obsure the fact that you attempt to obscure the source of your funds.

There is *no retroactive privacy* offered by using these tools. You can never delete or hide your past blockchain history.

This means any government auditor who wants to see your financial history just needs to know the original Bitcoin address
you used before fusing your coins and they can identify how much money you had AND the fact you you attempted to hide your future transaction history because CashFusion transactions are trivially [identifiable](https://stats.devzero.be/#/fusion) on the blockchain. If you had, for example, .1 Bitcoin at the address, it won't matter
much whether or not they can trace your coins themselves because they know how much you once had and where it was.

The auditor can simply issue an order to turn over the records of your transactions after you fused or mixed them that give a full accounting
up to the .1 Bitcoin that existed at that original address. Just because you obfuscated your
transactions to make them more difficult for them to trace doesn't get you off the hook
for providing the records if the auditors or investigators want them.

You can refuse, and hope they aren't able to trace your transactions through other means. It's possible the punishment for refusing to comply
wouldn't be as bad as the punishment for whatever you were trying to hide, but if that's the case, it would
have been better off to start with clean coins to begin with because mixing and fusion is currently identifiable on the blockchain, because using these tools
with identity-linked coins may invite unwanted scrutiny and alternative surveillance that can do a lot to identify your Bitcoin transaction history without
ever needing to trace anything on the blockchain itself.

CashFusion and coinmixers may offer some interesting privacy uses, but un-KYC is not one of them.
