>CashFusion is a fully decentralized privacy protocol that allows anyone to create multi-party transactions with other network participants. This process obscures your real spending and makes it difficult for chain-analysis companies to track your coins. - [CashFusion FAQ](https://cashfusion.org/faqs/)

### The claim

Browse r/btc and you will see people who care about privacy recommend 
CashFusion to help people regain the privacy of their Bitcoins after
years of privacy malpractice like KYC, single address use, and public address disclosure.

This is well-intentioned but dangerous advice.

### Why you shouldn't fuse your identity-linked coins

The problem is that, whatever forward-facing privacy CashFusion gives you, it
does nothing for your financial privacy up to the point you fused your coins. If you have
.1 Bitcoin in an address linked to your identity, CashFusion won't hide the fact that you had .1 Bitcoin
at some definite time in the past.

If a government auditor wants to see your financial history, all they need to know is the address
you used before fusing your coins. Since they know how much you had at that address, they can issue
an order for you to turn over the records of you transactions that give a full accounting
up to the .1 Bitcoin that existed at that original address. Just because you obfuscated your
transactions to make them more difficult for them to trace doesn't get you off the hook
for providing the records if the auditors want them.
