I think more people should have a space on the Internet that they fully control.

This is an open offer to give you $10 in your prefered fork of Bitcoin if you start a website for yourself and write something. I don't care what you write, or if you're a gifted writer or not. I just want to see a world where more people own their content and their platform online.

### Details

- It must be your own platform. Medium, Substack, etc, don't count. They're part of the problem.
- If you already have a blog, sorry.
- You must write at least 3 posts before claiming the reward and must link back to this page

### Recommendations

I recommened [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) pages and [Jekyll.](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) It's fast and easy to setup, and you will have a site that can never break unlike CMS heavy systems like WordPress.

I will create a running list of everyone who has participated in this so you can follow eachother's work.
