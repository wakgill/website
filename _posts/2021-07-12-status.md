I might start posting a regular status update as a blog post as an alternative to social media posting.

Since this is the first one, it will be short.

I launched my new blog, though I haven't settled on a name yet. I also wrote about why you [shouldn't un-KYC your Bitcoin with CashFusion.](/cfusion)

Since I haven't written much for an audience in so long, I feel stuffy and the words don't flow at all. I also feel a bit insecure about writing, which is not
a feeling I'm used to or comfortable in dealing with. I think I feel this way both beacuse I haven't done it in so long as also because of other things I may write about one day.

Today I'm reading from Isaac Asimov's autobiography, [*I, Asimov*](https://www.amazon.com/I-Asimov-Memoir-Isaac/dp/055356997X) and the novel *[The Powers of the Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Powers-Earth-Aristillus-Book-ebook/dp/B005JPPMS6)* by Travis Corcorran. Both are great.

I'm trying and failing to limit my exposure to news and trending social media topics. They are toxic, give an unrealistic portrait of the world and other people, and make me unhappy. Yet
like many people, I won't deny I'm almost addicted to it. Let's be honest about it, browsing Twitter for things that will make you shake your head in disapointment is our generation's mental junk food.
Most of us know it is very bad for us, but we keep going to eat it.

Ah! And I almost forgot, I'll give you $10 if you [start a blog.](/start-blog)
